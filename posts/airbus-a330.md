## First Class

The Airbus A340 is a long-range, wide-body passenger airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. In the
mid-1970s, Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300, its first airliner, and developed the A340 quadjet in
parallel with the A330 twinjet. In June 1987, Airbus launched both designs with their first orders and the A340-300 took
its maiden flight on 25 October 1991. It was certified along with the A340-200 on 22 December 1992 and both versions
entered service in March 1993 with launch customers Lufthansa and Air France. The larger A340-500/600 were launched on 8
December 1997; the A340-600 flew for the first time on 23 April 2001 and entered service on 1 August 2002.

Keeping the eight-abreast economy cross-section of the A300, the early A340-200/300 has a similar airframe to the A330.
Differences include four 151 kN (34,000 lbf) CFM56s instead of two high-thrust turbofans to bypass ETOPS restrictions on
trans-oceanic routes, and a three-leg main landing gear instead of two for a heavier 276 t (608,000 lb) MTOW. Both
airliners have fly-by-wire controls, which was first introduced on the A320, as well as a similar glass cockpit. The
later A340-500/600 have a larger wing and are powered by 275 kN (62,000 lbf) Rolls-Royce Trent 500 for a heavier 380 t (
840,000 lb) MTOW.

The shortest A340-200 measured 59.4 m (195 ft), and could cover 12,400 km / 6,700 nmi with 210–250 seats in 3-class. The
most common A340-300 reached 63.7 m (209 ft) to accommodate 250–290 passengers and had a 13,500 km / 7,300 nmi range.
The A340-500 was 67.9 m (223 ft) long to seat 270–310 over 16,670 km / 9,000 nmi, the longest-range airliner at the
time. The longest A340-600 was stretched to 75.4 m (247 ft), then the longest airliner, to accommodate 320–370
passengers over 14,450 km / 7,800 nmi.

As improving engine reliability allowed ETOPS operations for almost all routes, more economical twinjets have replaced
quadjets on many routes. On 10 November 2011, Airbus announced that the production reached its end, after 380 orders had
been placed and 377 delivered from Toulouse, France. The A350 is its successor; the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the
Boeing 777 were its main competitors. By the end of 2021, the global A340 fleet had completed more than 2.5 million
flights over 20 million block hours and carried over 600 million passengers with no fatalities. As of June 2022, there
were 207 A340 aircraft in service with 45 operators worldwide. Lufthansa is the largest A340 operator with 34 aircraft
in its fleet.

## Background

When Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, two established US aerospace manufacturers. From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun
studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.[3] Prior to the service introduction of
the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.[4] A tenth
variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.[5] It was a smaller
aircraft that would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle
market, which resulted in the Airbus A320 family, which was the first digital fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. The
decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within
Airbus.[5] As the SA or "single aisle" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to
challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC-9 in the single-aisle, narrow-body airliner market, Airbus turned its
focus back to the wide-body aircraft market.

The A300B11,[6] a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of "ten ton" thrust engines.[7] Using four
engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of 11,000 kilometres (6,000 nmi).[8] It was
deemed a replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service.[7] The A300B11 was joined by
another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early
1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the
most powerful turbofan engine available at the time.[7] It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity,
medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.[7] The B9 offered the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas
DC-10, but it used between 25%[7] to 38%[9] less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered a replacement for the DC-10 and
the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar.[10]

To differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for "
twin aisle"), respectively.[6] In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same
wing and airframe; the projected savings were estimated at US$500 million (about £490 million or €495 million).[11] The
adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the
weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief.[7] Another factor was the split preference of those within
Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown,
