The Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest
passenger airliner and only full-length double-deck jet airliner.

1. Cargo capacity: 6,498 ftÂ³
2. Cruise speed: 561 mph
3. Introduced: October 25, 2007
4. Number of seats: 853
5. Designer: Airbus
6. First flight: April 27, 2005
7. Engine types: Rolls-Royce Trent 900, Engine Alliance GP7000

## Production and delivery delays

Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km (330 mi) of wiring in each aircraft.
Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its
concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration
management and change control.[60][61] The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4, while
British and French sites migrated to version 5.[62] This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in
part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules
including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the
software.[63] File conversion tools were initially developed by Airbus to help solve this problem, however the digital
mock-up was still unable to read the full technical design data.[64] Furthermore, organisational culture was also cited
as a cause of the production delays. The communication and reporting culture at the time frowned upon delivery of bad
news, meaning Airbus was unable to take early actions to mitigate technical and production issues.

## Entry into service

Nicknamed Superjumbo,[91] the first A380, MSN003, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered
service on 25 October 2007 with flight number SQ380 between Singapore and Sydney.[92] Passengers bought seats in a
charity online auction paying between $560 and $100,380.[93] Two months later, Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng
stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline or Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per
seat-mile than the airline's 747-400 fleet.[94] Emirates' Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at
Mach 0.86 than at 0.83,[95] and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97%, the same as Singapore Airlines.
Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98.5%.[96]

Emirates was the second airline to receive the A380 and commenced service between Dubai and New York in August
2008.[97][98] Qantas followed, with flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles in October 2008.[99] By the end of 2008,
890,000 passengers had flown on 2,200 flights.[100]

Furthermore, in February 2008, the A380 became the first airliner to fly using synthetic liquid fuel. The fuel is
processed from gas to liquid form (GTL fuel). The flight was 3 hours long, taking off from Filton, UK, and landing in
Toulouse, France, and was a significant step in evaluating the suitability of sustainable aviation fuels.

## Engines

The A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan
engines.[154] The Trent 900 is a combination of the 3 m (118 in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent
8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core. The
GP7200 HP core technology is derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.[155] At its
launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be
state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing
technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.[156]
