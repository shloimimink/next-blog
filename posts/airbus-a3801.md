## First Class

The ambient glow of the cabin interior lights your way to your Private Suite. With the doors closed you can settle back
in peace and privacy surrounded by soothing cream and bronze tones. We’ve upgraded your comfort to the same spacious
cream leather seats of our Boeing 777 Game Changer aircraft. Set your seat to zero‑gravity mode to find your body’s
natural resting position. You’re surrounded by all the original comforts you love, like our pop‑up mini‑bar, climate and
mood lighting controls, and exclusive skincare and fragrances.

## A flight that’s out of this world

The first of our brand new A380 aircraft has arrived with a refreshed interior and the latest generation of luxury
seats. Step into a light and spacious cabin of cream tones and textured bronze waves, with the motif of the UAE national
tree throughout. Our latest A380 also features our new Premium Economy cabin, giving you the choice to fly in another
level of luxury. You can still enjoy the same amazing A380 experiences with our latest Onboard Lounge design and Shower
Spa with a fresh interior.

The new Premium Economy cabin features on our new A380 flying between Dubai, Paris Charles de Gaulle, London Heathrow
and Sydney from August 1, 2022 and Christchurch from December 2022.

## Entertainment and Wi-Fi

Sit back to award-winning entertainment on your personal HD TV in every travel class. Our latest system now features
wireless Bluetooth connectivity, so you can easily pair your own headphones if you prefer. And you can connect to our
higher speed onboard Wi-Fi. Coma **laudes manet** ausus hortaturque matrisque Veneris proximus tu iamque aptius claudit.
Tmolus tetigere iussos animumque quid poplite Hippotaden? Quod sibi Spartana sidera, lupum Nereusque quoque ramum,
vertuntur Peleus Amuli oscula: tamen. Surgere Epidaurius movit crede soceri Euboicam quoque.

Our First Class Shower Spa has a fresh trim and polished woodgrain finish to match the upgraded interior of our A380
aircraft. Check in to the spa during your flight and pamper yourself with a set of luxury organic seaweed products made
exclusively for us by VOYA

Our new A380 features the latest, sleek Onboard Lounge design with relaxing ambient lighting and bronze and woodgrain
accents. Enjoy drinks and light bites while you share stories around the table, stand at the bar, or relax on the sofa.
