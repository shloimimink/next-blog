## Airbus A340

The Airbus A340-600 is the largest of the Airbus jetliners and is a super-stretched version of the A340 family of
aircraft. One of the largest commercial aircraft in the world, the A340-600 provides a passenger capacity of 380 and a
range of 13,900km.

The A340-600 inaugural flight took place on 23 April 2001 and the aircraft was awarded type certification in June 2002.
The aircraft entered service with Virgin Atlantic Airways (launch customer with 20 aircraft on order) in August 2002
when it took its first commercial flight from London Heathrow to JFK New York.

Other customers include Air Canada (3), Cathay Pacific (3), China Eastern (3), Emirates (18), Etihad Airways of UAE (4),
Iberia (11), International Lease Finance (14), Lufthansa (17), Qatar Airways (4), South African Airways (6) and Thai
Airways (6).

In December 2006, Airbus delivered the first VIP version of the A340-600 to SAAD Air of Saudi Arabia. The VIP version
seats about 80 passengers.

The ultra-long-range A340-500, which made its first flight in February 2002, is 6.5m shorter and is capable of carrying
313 passengers with a range of 15,750km. The aircraft received European certification in December 2002 and entered
service with launch customer Emirates in November 2003.

Emirates ordered ten aircraft. It was also ordered by Air Canada (two), Etihad Airways (four), Qatar Airways (one),
Singapore Airlines (five) and Thai Airways (four). In February 2004, a Singapore Airlines A340-500 made the longest
non-stop commercial flight in aviation history – flying 14,093km (7,609nm) from Singapore to Los Angeles in 14 hours 42
minutes.

A total of 145 orders were received for the long-range A340-500/600 family – 105 (79 delivered) for the A340-600 and
38 (26 delivered) for the A340-500.

A new variant of the A340-600 made a maiden flight in November 2005. It is equipped with upgraded Rolls-Royce Trent 500
engines and uses construction techniques developed for the A380 such as laser beam welding. Its range is extended to
14,600km. The upgraded aircraft was certified by EASA (European Aviation and Safety Agency) in April 2006 and delivered
to launch customer. Qatar Airways shortly after.

In February 2008, an A340-600 was successfully tested with a new electric braking system developed by Messier-Bugatti
with Airbus. The test included landings with automatic braking and rejected take-offs.

## Airbus A340-600 flight deck

The flight deck on the A340-600 is almost identical to that of the basic A340 and there is very little difference
between the operating procedures of the two aircraft. As a consequence any pilot qualified to fly the A340 will need
only one or two days briefing to be flight rated for the A340-600. The Airbus Cross Crew Qualification (CCQ) program,
enabling pilots to transit from one Airbus fly-by-wire family to another through difference training, reduces training
time by 65% to 95% and significantly lowers training costs.

The multi-purpose control and display unit of the new flight management system developed by Thales and Smiths Industries
has six 6.25in x 6.25in liquid crystal displays.
